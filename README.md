# VISION-DRIVE-Smart-Drowsiness-Alert-System

Completed this project as part of my independent research on real-time safety solutions using computer vision and machine learning.

Key highlights:

Developed a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using facial landmarks and Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) analysis.

Integrated computer vision techniques with OpenCV, dlib, and scipy to monitor eye activity and detect signs of drowsiness.

Designed a full-screen interactive GUI using Tkinter with live video feed, alert dashboard, and fun safety tips for user engagement.

Implemented audio alerts using pygame mixer and pop-up warnings to notify the user when drowsiness is detected based on EAR thresholds.

Tracked and displayed session statistics, including number of alerts triggered, session duration, and time of last alert.

This project highlights my ability to combine machine learning concepts with real-time user interfaces and system-level alert mechanisms to address safety-critical applications in transportation.
